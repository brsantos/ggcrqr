The goal of ggcrqr is to â€¦

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("brsantos/ggcrqr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to estimate the model
considering the data available in the package: `m_breast_cancer`.

``` r
library(ggcrqr)
#> Loading required package: LaplacesDemon
#> Loading required package: truncnorm
## basic example code
## one should check whether the values for burn and jump are adequate.
model <- bayesGG(time_to_d ~ age_group + stage_c, 
                 data = m_breast_cancer, 
                 q = 0.5, d = "cens", burn = 30000, jump = 40, 
                 guess = c(-0.1, 0.5, rep(0, 6)))
